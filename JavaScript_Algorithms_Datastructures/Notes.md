# Basic JavaScript
* Comment code with // or by using /* */
* To initialize variable, use var and end with ;
* You can also initialize and assign at the same time
* Variables usually have first word in lowercase and subsequent words are capitalized
* You can assign variables to strings or integers or float numbers
* You can use +=, -=, *=, or /= when you want to do operation on same variable. This is called augmented [operation](addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
* Increment or decrement number with ++ or -- following variable
* You can find remainder of variable with modulus(%) 

# Strings
* Strings can be written with single or double quotes. To escape single or double quotes, precede it with \
* One must escape characters with \. 
    * \' - single quote
    * \" - double quote
    * \\ - backslash
    * \n - newline
    * \r - carriage return
    * \t - tab
    * \b - word boundary 
    * \f - form feed
* You can concatenate strings by using the addition sign +
* We can also concatenate with += operator, sort of like augmenting.
* You can insert variable when concatenating strings (string variable + string)
* We can append variables to string using += operator as well
* To find length of string variable, add .length at end of variable
* JavaScript uses zero-based indexing. Bracket notation can get character at specific index of string. 
* One can initalize string variable by just setting it to equal to ""
* String values are immutable in JavaScript. Only way is to reassign whole string variable 
* You can use bracket notation to find nth character in strings
* I can use the .length() function to get last character of string

# Arrays
* Arrays can have either numbers, strings, or both
* Arrays can be nested within other arrays, which is called multi-dimensional array
* Acess array by indexing
* Arrays are mutable
* Acess multidimensional array with indexes [][][]
* .push() can be used on arrays to append to end of it. Arrays can be appended to end of it
* .pop() can be used to pop element off end of array. It removes last element and returns it
* .shift() removes the first element of array. Works like how .pop() does
