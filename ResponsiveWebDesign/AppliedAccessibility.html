        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Should always include an alt attribute to images for description to visually impaired or in case image fails to load.</li>
                <li>If image already has some description, one can set the alt attribute to an empty string by adding ""</li>
                <li>Headings should have semantic meaning(indicates type of info tag contains) and not just be picked for their font size</li>
                <li>Tags with accessibility features: main, header, footer, nav, article, and section.</li>
                <li>An article is a sectioning element and is used to wrap indepdenent, self-contained content. Tag works well with blog entries, forum posts, or news articles. A section is for grouping thematically related content.</li>
                <li>The header tag is used to qrap introductory info or navigation links for its parent tag and works well around content that's repeated at top on multiple pages. </li>
                <li>The nav element is meant to wrap around the main navigation links in page.</li>
                <li>The footer element is primarily used to contain copyright info or links to related documents at bottom of page.</li>
                <li>The audio element gives meaning when wrapped around sound or audio stream content in markup. Audio content also needs text alternative. Can add nearby text or link to transcript. One can also add controls attribute to show play, pause, and other controls.</li>
                <li>One can also add figure element and related figcaption to wrap items like images, diagrams, or charts. </li>
                <li>The for attribute on the label tag explicitly associates that label with the form control.</li>
                <li>A fieldset tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons. It uses a legend tag to provide description for grouping.</li>
                <li>The time element and datetime attribute is used to standardize times. The time element is an inline element that can wrap a date or time on a page. datetime attribute holds valid format of that date. </li>
                <li>To visually hide content meant only for screen readers, add the following: position: absolute; left: -10000px;width: 1px; height: 1px; top: auto; overflow: hidden;</li>
                <li>Improve readability with higher contrast text. Use color of text to do so.</li>
                <li>Avoid colorblindness issues by using sufficient contrast with hsl() function in both color and background-color</li>
                <li>When including links with a tags, wrap them around descriptive texts rather than with "Click here" text. </li>
                <li>HTML offers accesskey attribute to specify a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element. most useful with links, buttons, and form controls.</li>
                <li>The tabindex attribute has 3 distinct functions. On a tag, it indicates element can be focused on.</li>
                <li>Use tabindex to specify order of keyboard focus for several elements.</li>
