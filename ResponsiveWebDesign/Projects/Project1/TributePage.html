        <p> Here's a time line of von Neumann's life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1903</strong> - Born in Budapest, Kingdon of Hungary</li>
            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Began university studies in chemical engineering rather than mathematics.</li>
            <li><strong>1923</strong> - Entered as Ph.D. candidate in mathematics and chose to produce axiomatization of Cantor's set theory.</li>
            <li><strong>1932</strong> - Published set of papers that made contributions to ergodic theory, a branch of mathematics involving states of dynamical systems with an invariant measure</li>
            <li><strong>1936</strong> - Founded field of continuous geometry, a substitute of complex project geometry.</li>
            <li><strong>1941</strong> - Derived exact distirbution of ratio of mean squares of successive differences to sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables</li>
            <li><strong>1945</strong> - Invented merge sort algorithm</li>
            <li><strong>1948</strong> - Proposed kinematic self-reproducing automaton</li>
            <li><strong>1955</strong> - Diagnosed with cancer</li>
            <li><strong>1957</strong> - Died at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C</li>
        </ul>
