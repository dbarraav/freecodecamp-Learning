                <p>
                    Classification is used to assign an observation to a specific category within
                    a set of categories. Here are two different types of classification: binary classification
                    and multiclass classification. <br>
                    With binary classification, one can assign elements of a set into two groups based a rule.
                    Some of the methods used for binary classification are: decision trees, bayesian
                    networks, support vector machines and probit model.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    One method of SVM is the linear SVM. The linear SVM can be used to classify data into two classes.
                    The following code can be used to import modules to accomplish the linear SVM. 
                </p>
                <code>
                    from sklearn import svm<br>
                    from sklearn import metrics<br>
                    from sklearn.neighboers import KNeighborsClassifier
                </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Clustering">
                <header>Clustering</header>
                <p>
                    With clustering, one can group observation/objects into clusters. Observations
                    in one cluster are more similar than to those in other groups/clusters. Below 
                    is a list of some of the algorithms used for clustering: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fuzzy clustering</li>
                    <li>Expectation Maximization</li>
                    <li>BIRCH</li>
                    <li>DBSCAN</li>
                    <li>K-Means</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clusterting using Hierarchies(BIRCH) can cluster
                    large datasets by creating a summary of the large dataset to retain as much 
                    info as possible. In order to use the BIRCH algorithm, one can import the following
                    modules:
                </p>
                <code>
                    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
                    from sklearn.datasets.samples_generator import make_blobs<br>
                    from sklearn.cluster import Birch
                </code>

                <p>
                    In order to use the DBSCAN algorithm, one can import the following module:
                </p>
                <code>
                    from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
                </code>
            </section>

            <section class="main-section" id="Regression">
                <header>Regression</header>
                <p>
                    Regression can be used to estimate relationship between a dependent variables 
                    and one or more independent variables. There are different types of regression:
                    linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression, and classifiers.
                    Below is a module to import for logistic regression:
                </p>
                <code>
                    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
                </code>
                <p>
                    Below is a module to import for linear regression
                </p>
                <code>
                    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
                </code>
                <p>
                    One should note that there is no method for calculating power and sample size. 
                    We can take into account the rule made by Good and Hardin.

                <p>
                    Feature engineering consists of extracting features from data. It can be 
                    used for predictive models and has been seen in code competitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a list of feature engineering techniques: imputation, categorical 
                    encoding, binning, scaling, log transform, feature selection, and feature 
                    grouping.

                <p>
                    Reinforcement learning is part of machine learning in which we look at how 
                    agents take action in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward.
                    This fiel is studied in other disciplines such as game theory, control theory, 
                    operations research, information theory, smilation-based optimization, multi-agent
                    sysstems, swarm intelligence, and statistics.
