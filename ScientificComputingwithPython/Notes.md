# Notes
## Why Program?
* Programmers anticipate needs
* Computer = hardware and software

## Hardware Architecture
* Input Devices: keyboard, mouse, and touch screen
* Output Devices: screen, speakers, printer, DVD burner
* Software:
    * Central Processing Unit- runs the program
    * Main Memory: fast small temporary storage
* Secondary Memory(Hard Drive): slower large permanent storage

* Python is translated to machine language before transferred to main memory and eventually CPU

## Python as a Language
* Syntax Errors: Always continue learning

## Elements of Python
* There are some words that are reserved and cannot be used as variable names/identifiers
* Script is a just a file that can be used to run Python code rather than doing so interactively through command line
* There are three types of steps: sequential, conditional, and repeated

## Variables, Expressions, and Statements
* Constants as fixed values
* Variables are named places where data is stored for later retrieval
* Variables must start with letter of underscorea and consist of letters, numbers, and underscores. They should also be case sensitive

## Intermediate Expressions
* Type of variable matters
    * type()
    * bool(), int(), float(), str()
* Order of operations - PEMDAS and left to right
* Input function is input()

## Conditional Execution
* Comparison operators
* Indentation is necessary
* Nested decisions
* Visualize blocks

## More Conditional Structures
* elif statement
* Try and except structure
    * Code in try works if accepted. Else, code in except block is accepted

## Python Functions
* def creates function
    * Built-in functions
        * Type conversions
        * String conversions

## Build your own Functions
* First define and then invoke/call functions
* return keyword is used to exit function and return value of function

## Loops and Iterations
* while loop(aka indefinite loops) runs until condition is False
* break statement can be used to exit out of loop
* continue statement can be used to skip the current iteration

## Definite Loops
* for loop(aka definite loop)

## Loop Idioms
* Make smart loops

## More Patterns
* Counter variable
* Sum variable
* Loop used for finding average, filtering, searching for boolean variable, finding min/max value
* is statement is much stronger than using ==.
    * 0 == 0.0 is considered True
    * 0 is 0.0 is considered False

## Strings in Python
* String is sequence of characeters
* Uses ' or " 
* For strings, + means concatenate
* Read data using strings before converting to integers/floats

## Intermediate Strings
